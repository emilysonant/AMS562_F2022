I created 4 folders using mkdir named homeworks, midterm_project, final_project, and README.
In the homeworks folder, I made a folder named hw1 and then used touch to create this README file inside of hw1.
In the midterm_project and final_project folders I also used touch to make empty README files.
I used Git Branch -M to make a new branch called add_class_folders so that I would not be adding my new folders into the master branch.
Throughout the process, I used commands such as cd to go to different levels in my directory, ls to see the files in my directory, git status to check the status of my files, and rm to remove any accidental files/folders I created.
Finally, I used git add to stage all my folders and then git commit to commit them. Then I used git merge to add them to my master, and finally git push to push them onto GitHub.
