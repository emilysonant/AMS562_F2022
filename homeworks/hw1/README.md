# Homework 1 Explanation

## Folders Created
I created 4 folders using mkdir named homeworks, midterm_project, final_project, and README.
In the [homeworks](https://github.com/emilysonant/AMS562_F2022/tree/main/homeworks/hw1) folder, I made a folder named hw1 and then used touch to create this README file inside of hw1.
In the [midterm_project](https://github.com/emilysonant/AMS562_F2022/tree/main/midterm_project) and [final_project](https://github.com/emilysonant/AMS562_F2022/tree/main/final_project)  folders I also used touch to make empty README files.

## Using Git Branch
I used Git Branch -M to make a new branch called add_class_folders so that I would not be adding my new folders into the master branch.

## Other Commands Used
Throughout the process, I used commands such as cd to go to different levels in my directory, ls to see the files in my directory, git status to check the status of my files, and rm to remove any accidental files/folders I created.

## Staging and Commiting Folders
Finally, I used git add to stage all my folders and then git commit to commit them. Then I used git merge to add them to my master, and finally git push to push them onto GitHub.

> After class where you explained your expectations, I understood that I was not supposed to merge my work and instead submit a pull request. I will submit a pull request for my new updates.
